Design Ideas:
- Use different font style for each quiz
- Sound effects for wrong and right answer
- add unicorn reward


Stretch Goals:
- Try using jQuery instead?
- Figure out how to use forEach() and map() to populate
the options options Buttons?
// optnBtns.forEach (btn => btn.textContent= );

//answers.map(n => "<button>" + n  + "</button>");
- have an array of different pass fail messages that get called at random
- show an animated time bar to show when question will change
